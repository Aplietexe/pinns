## Problem Statement
The current transformer-based autoregressive model for predicting power series coefficients is failing to converge to acceptable losses:
- **Current performance**: Adam optimizer leaves losses > 0.5 for Legendre, > 0.07 for Airy, ~1e5-1e7 for Hermite/Beam
- **Target performance**: Direct parameter optimization achieves ~1e-14 losses for all ODEs
- **Goal**: Achieve similar performance with a model that autoregressively predicts coefficients

## Current Architecture Analysis
- **Model**: `_ARTransformerCoeffNet` with causal self-attention
- **Input**: Prefix of coefficients [a₀, ..., aₖ₋₁] 
- **Output**: Next coefficient aₖ
- **Training**: Two-stage (Adam + LBFGS) with PDE, BC, and recurrence losses

- **Results**:
  - Airy: [0.3552, -0.2587, 0.0028] ✓ **Still excellent!**
  - Legendre: [0.0003, 0.0003, 0.0004] ✗ **Failed** (should be [0,0,0,0,0,30,...])
  - Hermite: [-43.19, -0.35, 86.05] ✗ **Failed** (should be [-120,0,720,...])
  - Beam: [5.68e-8, 5.52e-8, 5.39e-8] ✗ **Failed** (should be [0,0,0,0,0.25,...])
- **Analysis**: 
  - MLP works excellently for Airy but fails on others
  - Problem: Different ODEs have very different coefficient magnitudes
  - Airy has O(1) coefficients, others have much larger/smaller values

### Experiment 4: RNN Test on All ODEs - MAJOR LOSS ANALYSIS
- **Date**: 2025-07-16
- **Method**: Test RNN (GRU) with increased iterations and loss tracking on all 4 ODEs
- **Target Performance**: ~1e-14 loss (from direct optimization baseline)
- **Results**:
  - **Legendre**: Loss = **2.21e+00** ✗ **CATASTROPHIC FAILURE**
    - Coeffs: [-0.0053, -0.0111, -0.0163, -0.0214, -0.0148] (expected [0,0,0,0,0,30,...])
  - **Airy**: Loss = **9.24e-06** ✓ **ACCEPTABLE** (but not excellent)
    - Coeffs: [0.35503, -0.25882, 4.18e-05, 0.0593, -0.0217] (expected [0.35503, -0.25882, ~0,...])
  - **Hermite**: Loss = **9.45e+05** ✗ **CATASTROPHIC FAILURE**
    - Coeffs: [-37.93, -37.93, 119.01, 32.66, -3.20] (expected [-120, 0, 720, 0, -120,...])

- **Critical Analysis**: 
  - **ONLY AIRY WORKS**: RNN achieves acceptable loss only on Airy equation
  - **Massive gap**: Other ODEs have losses 1e6 to 1e11 times worse than target
  - **Pattern Recognition**: 
    - Legendre and Beam produce nearly constant coefficients → model collapse
    - Hermite produces wrong coefficient pattern → wrong recurrence learning
    - Airy works → coefficients have similar magnitude, good for normalization
  - **Root Cause**: Current RNN architecture cannot generalize across different ODE coefficient patterns
- **Next**: Need fundamental architecture improvements for other ODEs

    - Coeffs: [2.99e-07, 2.99e-07, 2.99e-07, 2.99e-07, 2.99e-07] → [2.99e-07, 2.99e-07, 2.99e-07, 2.99e-07, 2.99e-07]
    - Still complete model collapse
- **Analysis**: 
  - **Breakthrough for Hermite**: Adaptive normalization allows proper coefficient pattern learning
  - **Airy nearly solved**: Very close to target performance
  - **Legendre improving**: No longer constant coefficients, but still wrong pattern
  - **Beam still failing**: Complete model collapse persists
- **Next**: Focus on remaining issues with Legendre and Beam equations

### Experiment 6: Fixed RNN with Boundary Condition Handling - MIXED RESULTS
- **Date**: 2025-07-16
- **Method**: Modified RNN to treat first m coefficients as boundary-condition-determined, not autoregressive
- **Key Insight**: Beam equation's model collapse was due to trying to predict BC-constrained coefficients autoregressively
- **Target Performance**: ~1e-14 loss (from direct optimization baseline)
- **Results** (comparing improved vs fixed RNN):
  - **Legendre**: 2.01e+00 → 2.01e+00 ✓ **PATTERN IMPROVEMENT**
    - Coeffs: [0.0020, 0.0013, -0.0209, -0.0484, -0.0674] → [0.0000, 0.0000, -0.0281, -0.0370, -0.0388]

    - Complete model collapse - all coefficients become zero
  - **Hermite**: 1.80e+05 → 1.44e+06 ✗ **REGRESSION**
    - Coeffs: [-107.95, 2.39, 549.43, -4.76, -244.90] → [0., 0., 0., 0., 0.]
    - Complete model collapse - all coefficients become zero

    - Coeffs: [2.99e-07, 2.99e-07, 2.99e-07, 2.99e-07, 2.99e-07] → [0., 0., 0., 0., 9.68e-04]
    - First 4 coeffs now correctly zero (boundary conditions)
- **Critical Analysis**: 
  - **Partial Success**: Fixed approach correctly handles boundary conditions for Legendre and Beam
  - **Major Regression**: Breaks previously working Airy and Hermite cases
